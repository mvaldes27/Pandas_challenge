# Heroes of Pymoli Analysis



**Based on thorough analysis of purchase data from Heroes of Pymoli, several trends can be observed:

	* The bulk of consumers are male (84.03%), but males, females, and players of non-disclosed gender 
	had similar average purchase prices. Average total purchases per person were slightly higher in females 
	and players of non-disclosed gender, which suggests potential for growth if more focus is placed on items 
	marketed toward those demographics. 
	
	* The majority of consumers are between 20-24 years old (44.79%), followed by the 15-19 year old range (18.58%). 
	Average total purchases per person rise from $4.32 per person in the 20-24 year old range, 
	to $4.76 per person in the 35-39 year old range. 
	
	* The two most popular items (“Final Critic” and “Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm”) were also the most profitable. 
	Items such as “Nirvana”, “Fiery Glass Crusader” and Singed Scalpel” were purchased a similar number of times 
	as more popular items of lesser value, suggesting that a small increase in item price did not deter users from purchasing items.
